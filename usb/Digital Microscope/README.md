## Notes

This was dumped from a USB 2.0 Digital Microscope, these are VERY generic and can be found by searching `USB 2.0 Digital Microscope 1000x` in your preferred marketplace (amazon/ebay/aliexpress), an example can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M2XK6BV). This utilizes a [Atmel AT24C64N](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/AT24C64N-10SI-2-7/386192) and was dumped using a CH341A with AsProgrammer.

Also of note, this device is using a QFN28 ic with the label below, however I'm unsure what it is exactly.
