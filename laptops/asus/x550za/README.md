## Notes
This was dumped from a laptop motherboard [winbond W25Q32FVsig](https://www.winbond.com/hq/product/code-storage-flash-memory/serial-nor-flash/?__locale=en&partNo=W25Q32FV) using a CH341A with AsProgrammer. I'm unsure what laptop it was, or whether any bios settings or passwords were configured.
